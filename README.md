# Weather-Tracker

## Description
This project is a weather Tracker that you can use to check the weather in a city before traveling there. Allows you to search a city and then displays the weather in that city for the day, 
as well as a 5 day forecast of the weather in specified city. It also saves to local storage so previously searched citys will render on the page as well. This project helped me gain a further understanding in javascript as well as helping me learn about server apis and jquery

## Installation
Simply copy the repo into your github or local machine and open the code using a code editor, then open the HTML in a browser or using a live server alternatively, you may visit the deployed page on my github or from the link below

## Usage
In using this application you`ll be able to type a query into the search bar and press search, after doing this your search will be saved into local storage and the page will update to splay the current weather in the queried city, as well as the future weather for the next 5 days. The weather displayed will be the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. You will also see an icon to represent the type of weather you may see in the city, whether that be sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc. By closing the browser and reopening it you will see that your previous searches will be saved and accessible under the search bar.
